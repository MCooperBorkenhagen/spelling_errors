The idea here is that a phonology-to-orthography error on SfV should
tell us something about the individuals latent OP knowledge given that
these errors are likely in absence of knowledge of the word itself.

For example, someone may spell the SfV version of ASSIDUOUS as ACIDUOUS.
They may or may not have encountered the target word here (ASSIDUOUS) and
they may have encountered the word more in one modality (print, speech)
than the other.

Ideas:

Modality matters. Did they consider this? My guess is that all of these
words are more frequent in print than in speech. Maybe not. We should look.
A word like "embarassed" is more common in adult spoken language, and a
word like "soliloquy" is more common in print. This matters.
